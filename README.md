# Intelligent Email Automation with GPT and Gmail API

SMP **Intelligent Email Automation** project! This system integrates the OpenAI GPT API with the Gmail API to automate email responses intelligently. It fetches unread emails, generates context-aware replies using GPT-4, and sends responses via Gmail, all while maintaining logs and handling errors gracefully.

## Introduction

This project automates the process of reading unread emails, generating intelligent responses using the OpenAI GPT API, and sending replies via the Gmail API. It's designed to save time and enhance productivity by handling routine email communications automatically.

---

## Features

- **Fetch Unread Emails**: Retrieves unread emails from your Gmail inbox.
- **Intelligent Reply Generation**: Uses GPT-4 to generate context-aware and professional email responses.
- **Automated Email Sending**: Sends the generated replies back to the original sender.
- **Email Management**: Marks emails as read after processing to prevent duplication.
- **Logging**: Maintains detailed logs of activities and errors for monitoring and debugging.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7 or higher**
- **Google Cloud Platform account** with Gmail API enabled
- **OpenAI account** with access to the GPT API
- **Basic knowledge of Python**
- **Familiarity with APIs and handling JSON data**

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/intelligent_email_automation.git
cd intelligent_email_automation
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Required Libraries

Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Obtain API Keys and Credentials

#### OpenAI GPT API

- **Sign Up**: Create an account at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup/).
- **Generate API Key**: Navigate to the API keys section and create a new secret key.

#### Gmail API

- **Google Cloud Console**: Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- **Create a New Project**: If you don't have one already.
- **Enable Gmail API**: Search for Gmail API in the API Library and enable it.
- **Configure OAuth Consent Screen**: Set up the consent screen (choose **External** for testing).
- **Create OAuth Client ID Credentials**:
  - Application Type: **Desktop App**
  - Download the `credentials.json` file and place it in the project directory.

### 5. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root to securely store sensitive information.

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_email@gmail.com
```

- Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your actual OpenAI API key.
- Replace `your_email@gmail.com` with the email address you want to use.

### 6. Create the Logs Directory

Set up a directory to store log files.

```bash
mkdir logs
touch logs/app.log
```

---

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   - On the first run, a browser window will open for Google authentication.
   - After authenticating, the script will start processing unread emails.

3. **Check the Logs**

   - Review `logs/app.log` to monitor activities and check for errors.

### Scheduling the Script

To automate the email processing, schedule the script to run at regular intervals.

#### Using Cron (Unix-based Systems)

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add the following line to run the script every hour:

```bash
0 * * * * /path/to/venv/bin/python /path/to/intelligent_email_automation/main.py
```
